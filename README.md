# infix-to-postfix-postfix-calculator
Converts Infix to Postfix and then solves it by using postfix.<br>
Uses a stack to convert, uses 2 stacks to solve it by using postfix.<br>
For now, it only works with one digit numbers and expressions that results in one digit number(For example 2+9 will result in gibberish because 11 has two digits).

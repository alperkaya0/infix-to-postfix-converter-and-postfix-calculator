# infix-to-postfix-postfix-calculator

This project is one hundred percent peculiar. It was asked at one of the Akbank's coding exam.

- Converts Infix to Postfix and then solves it by using postfix.
- Uses a stack to convert, uses 2 stacks to solve it by using postfix.
- For now, it only works with one digit numbers and expressions that results in one digit number(For example 2+9 will result in gibberish because 11 has two digits).
